NAME: ping

DESCRIPTION:
ping can be used to check if a server is up or not.
ping also returns the time it took for the server to respond.
this is a very useful tool for server administrators to test if their servers are functioning properly or undergoing an attack.
Script kiddies (kids who unknowingly use software to attack networks) use the ping command to send a huge amount of packages to a server with as goal to overload the server with data so it stops responding.
ping in mtjailed has left out functionality for sending large packages or an x amount of packages in order to prevent abuse of the command.
