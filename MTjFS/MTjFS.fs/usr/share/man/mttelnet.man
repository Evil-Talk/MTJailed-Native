NAME: mttelnet

DESCRIPTION:
MTTelnet is an alternative to the convenience of openSSH or dropbear on a jailbroken device.
It allows users to execute commands remotely given the ip and port of the MTTelnet server.
MTTelnet is based on an opensource project called GCDTelnetServer.
MTTelnet's biggest difference in comparison to SSH is that SSH provides authentication, encryption and port-forwarding functionality.
MTTelnet currently does not require authentication.
