NAME: nonce

DESCRIPTION:
========== Downgrading using a nonce ============

 # When your iPhone is jailbroken
	You can downgrade if you saved shsh2 blobs for the version you want to downgrade to.
	To be able to downgrade you need to set a nonce.
	Setting a nonce is as easy as executing the setnonce command, followed by the nonce.

 # When your iPhone is not Jailbroken
	Keep saving as many shsh2 blobs for your iPhones
	When an exploit is released that gains kernel priviliges you can downgrade
	Even when KPP is not bypassed yet.
 
 # How to save on-device blobs if signing already stopped
	Use ktool to save the blobs that are on your device.
	The blob is for the version that your device is currently on.
