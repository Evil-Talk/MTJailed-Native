NAME: ls

DESCRIPTION:
ls is a command used to list files on the filesystem.
ls / will for example list all files and directories that are readable and located in iOS rootfs.
ls without an argument specified will return the files and directories located in the current directory.
Note that not all directories on the iOS filesystem are accessible and viewable due to sandbox restrictions.
