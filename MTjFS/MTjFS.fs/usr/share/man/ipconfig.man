NAME: ipconfig

DESCRIPTION:
ipconfig is a command used for showing you the configuration of your network interface.
since iOS sandbox restrictions and kernel restrictions do not permit applications to read the mac address of the iOS device, I can not integrate this functionality in the command.
ipconfig in mtjailed can show you your network interface name, local ip, subnet mask and network interface status.
An attempt to get the mac address is added for older 'legacy (iOS 9)' devices.
