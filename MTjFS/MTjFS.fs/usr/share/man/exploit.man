NAME: exploit

DESCRIPTION:
An exploit is code that makes use of vulnerabilities or bugs in an operating system.
Exploits are commonly known to be used in malware and jailbreaks.
Since an exploit always bypasses security protocols they are valuable to attackers and software vendors.
Using an exploit an attacker can for example steal or take data for ransom.
An attacker can also choose to bypass restrictions of the Operating System in other to gain more priviliges.
iOS does not provide any detection against malware attacks or use of exploits.
The vendor, Apple states that it is important that users keep there iOS devices up to date with the latest iOS versions if they do not want to become victim of malware.
In the jailbreaking community updating is not recommended as a jailbreak requires the system to be vulnerable to exploits, leaving devices vulnerable.
