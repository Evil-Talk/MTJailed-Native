# MTJailed-Native
A terminal emulator with remote shell for non-jailbroken iOS devices

## About
MTJailed brings a command line to any iOS device. The devices does not have to be jailbroken.
MTJailed focuses on getting the most features a jailbroken device with a CLI would have.
MTJailed tries to get these features without infringing security policies of the iOS operating system and runs inside the sandbox.

## Not completely opensource yet
MTJailed uses some reverse engineered private API's, it is not legal to publish these to the public as it infringes Apple's licenses and DMCA.
I (The creator), will be willing to opensource the app including the private frameworks once the final version of the App has been built and we earned enough money to finance full support for the application (API's, designers, hosting services and other resources).
