# MTJailed-Native
A terminal emulator with remote shell for non-jailbroken iOS devices

## About

MTJailed brings a command line to any iOS device without requiring it to be jailbroken.

MTJailed tries to impliment as much features as a jailbroken device with a CLI has.

MTJailed's intention is to function without touching iOS Security policies, while running inside the sandbox.

## Not completely opensource yet

MTJailed uses some reverse engineered private API's.

Using them in Applications is infringing Apple's software end-user license agreement.

It is  illegal to publish Apple Private API Source code online.

Therefore no private API headers or frameworksz will be provided in this repository.

I (The creator), will be opensourcing the app once the final development state of the app is reached.

The project is currently relying on donations by beta users. (needed for API's, designers, hosting services and other resources).

## Using  the code in this repository

Requires you to visibly add a credit saying "Built with code from Sem Voigtlander" or anything else that credits me for my work.

Let me know when you use code from this repository as I might write about your project.

When you use code from this repository you also need to opensource your project here on Github.

## Resources I used
- Apple SpringBoard Private Framework
- Apple's lzss compression algorithm
- liblorgnette
- GCDTelnetServer
- PureFTPD
- WatchSpringBoard Prototype
- triple_fetch by Ian Beer (Google Project Zero)
- Execve considered harmful, by Sem Voigtlander
- Respring bug, by Sem Voigtlander, Vincent Desmurs and Joseph Shenton

## Special thanks to

- Joseph Shenton, for teaching me about table views.
- Jonathan Levine, for creating public posts about analyzing the iOS kernel
- Ian Beer, Luca Todesco and siguza for their public kernel and sandbox exploits.

[Hostinger](http://hotsinger.com)

For the great hosting service where we store our API's.

[Apple Inc](https://apple.com), for allowing so much from within the sandbox.


## Supporting and betatesting the app
Each donation brings me closer to the release of the app and each supporter gets a beta version of the app with weekly updates.

So far around $150 were earned from which $120 went to hosting and $30 to an online course for C programming / stack exploitation.

It is currently uncertain how long exactly it will take before the app becomes fully opensource but in the mean time I will be opensourcing parts of it.
